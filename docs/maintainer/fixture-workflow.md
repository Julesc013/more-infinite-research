# Fixture Workflow

Use fixtures to turn compatibility claims, bug reports, and risk cases into
repeatable evidence.

1. Add or update a fixture mod under `fixtures/`.
2. Add a post-MIR assertion fixture when behavior must be proved after MIR runs.
3. Register the fixture in `.mir/fixtures.yml` when it backs a durable claim.
4. Update `.mir/claims.yml` or the canonical claim JSON if public wording
   changes.
5. Run static validation first, then runtime validation with a Factorio binary.
