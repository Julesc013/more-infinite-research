# Test Results

This file records local release-candidate validation runs. It is not a substitute for the manual mod matrix in `docs/compatibility.md`.

## 2026-06-30 v2.0.0 Release-Candidate Hardening

Environment:

- Factorio `2.1.8` build `86744`, Windows Steam, Space Age install.
- Mod version `2.0.0`.
- Release archive: `dist/more-infinite-research_2.0.0.zip`.

Commands:

```powershell
.\scripts\Test-MIRLocales.ps1 -AllowMissingSupportedLanguages
git diff --check
.\scripts\Build-MIRPackage.ps1
.\scripts\Invoke-MIRValidation.ps1 -StaticOnly
.\scripts\Invoke-MIRValidation.ps1 -FactorioBin "C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Factorio\bin\x64\factorio.exe"
```

Results:

- Locale validation passed for 9 locale files.
- Static validation passed, including metadata, no compatibility-mod dependency policy, docs policy scan, no old `data.raw.tool` science-pack authority, no generated `icon_mipmaps`, changelog format, release package metadata, source-to-zip comparison, and `git diff --check`.
- Runtime fixture validation passed and created the expected save.
- Runtime diagnostics generated `research_science_pack_productivity` with `mir-fixture-science-pack` included.
- The post-MIR assertion fixture `mir-fixture-assert-science-pack-productivity` loaded successfully, proving the custom item-based science-pack recipe received a `change-recipe-productivity` effect.

Representative runtime log evidence:
